👋🏿 These are small weekly projects that I am working on using the **TidyTuesday** datasets.

## 🧠 What this project is about
I explored the dataset and made some basic visualizations. Will probably do some simple anaylses for each dataset later on.
I'd also like to get some practice using GitHu

The goal is simply to practice working with different types of data — nothing fancy, just learning by doing and having fun.

## 📁 What’s in this repo
the R scriptswith my code for this project.
- *(I’ll add more files later as I learn!)*

## 🪄 Tools I used
- R
- The `tidytuesdayR` package to load the data
- `tidyverse` to clean, transform, and visualize data

## 🌱 Why I’m sharing this
I’m using GitHub to track my learning and experiments in R.
I'd also like to use this space to get more comfortable with GitHub learning how to push, commit, and organize my work as I go.
It’s mostly for me — but if others find it interesting, that’s a bonus!
